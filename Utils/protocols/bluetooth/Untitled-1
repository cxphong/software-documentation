1. Maximum ble connection of android and iOS?
Android: 
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/bluetooth/bluedroid/+/master/include/bt_target.h#1428
- GATT_MAX_APPS = 32 # all devices includes connecting and not called gatt.close()
trangely enough, directly after booting your phone will be already on 5 or 6 so I guess Android itself uses the first ones. 
- GATT_MAX_PHY_CHANNEL = 7 # maximum simulataous connections

2. How about reconnect of android and iOS?
Should set autoReconnect = false, set true make connection hang out

3. How about bluetooth 5.0?

4. Loss data of ble?

5. How to show devices ble on bluetooth settings of iOS?
- MFi devices
- HID

6. Review reliable write?

7. Debug HCI on Android/iOS

8. write response/without response
response/without response of peripheral

9. pairing/bonding
ble connect without paring
